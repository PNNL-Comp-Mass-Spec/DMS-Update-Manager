DMS Update Manager Change Log

Version 1.2.6519; November 6, 2017
	- Convert to C#
	- Use PRISM-Library versions of clsParseCommandLine and XmlSettingsFileAccessor
	- Synchronize clsProcessFilesOrFoldersBaseClass and clsProcessFoldersBaseClass with other projects

Version 1.2.6306; April 7, 2017
	- Update clsParseCommandLine
	- Update to .NET 4.6.2

Version 1.2.6072; August 16, 2016
	- In the few cases where the ExecutablePath is not available for a process, use the CommandLine for the checks on the path.

Version 1.2.6060; August 4, 2016
	- Show the ProcessId of the process using a folder and thus blocking updates of files in that folder
	- Do not try to update the running instances of DMSUpdateManager.exe

Version 1.2.6058; August 2, 2016
	- Updated check of folders in use by other processes to use ExecutablePath from WMI instead of CommandLine for checking the .exe location
		- Command line may have a relative path to the exe, while ExecutablePath is always the full path
	- Fix bug in UpdateFolderWork deleting target folders with flag file _DeleteSubDir_.txt
	- Honor PreviewMode when deleting files marked with .delete
	- Refactor to remove redundant code

Version 1.2.6057; August 1, 2016
	- Added the "Jar file in use" logic to the rollback logic
	- Added new logic to check command lines of currently running processes for the folder containing the file to be updated, skipping the file copy if there is a file/executable in use in the target folder
		- This will allow updating programs while they are in use on some pubs, without breaking the currently running jobs.
	- Changed the "file in use" logic to allow copying a new file (i.e., doesn't exist in target folder) when the target folder is in use

Version 1.1.5968; May 4, 2016
	- No longer logging that a .jar file is in use if the .jar file doesn't actually need to be updated

Version 1.1.5959; April 25, 2016
	- Update to .NET 4.5.1

Version 1.1.5864; January 21, 2016
	- Add file suffix .checkjava to skip .jar files in use by Java
	- Removed reboot/shutdown logic since no longer used

Version 1.1.5669; July 10, 2015
	- Now logging the size and modification times of the old and the new file when updating

Version 1.1.5290; June 26, 2014
	- Added support for _AMSubDir_.txt flag files

Version 1.1.5037; October 16, 2013
	- Now making sure that duplicate warning messages for skipped files appear a minimum of 24 hours apart

Version 1.1.4521; May 18, 2012
	- Updated to .NET 4

Version 1.1.4478; April 5, 2012
	- Added parameter blnProcessingSubFolder to several functions

Version 1.1.4275; September 15, 2011
	- Switched from .Now to .UtcNow

Version 1.1.4239; August 10, 2011
	- Now looking for file _PushDir_.txt in source folders
		- If the file exists in the source folder, then the folder is copied to the target even if it doesn't yet exist at the target
	- Added support for flag files _DeleteSubDir_.txt and _DeleteAMSubDir_.txt

Version 1.1.4206; July 8, 2011
	- Now looking for files with a suffix of .delete
		- If found, then deletes the file with the same name in the target folder if it exists
		- For example, if the source folder has file PeptideProphetLibrary.dll.delete in it
		  then PeptideProphetLibrary.dll will get deleted in the target folder
	- Updated to Visual Studio 2010

Version 1.0.4129; April 22, 2011
	- Now looking for files with a suffix of .rollback
		- If found, then forces an update of a file if date or size differs, even if the target file is newer
		- For example, if the source folder has file UIMFLibrary.dll.rollback in it
		  then UIMFLibrary.dll will get copied to the target folder even if the date 
		  of the file in the target folder is newer, like this:

			Source folder              Date                 Target Folder    Date
			UIMFLibrary.dll            3/2/2011             UIMFLibrary.dll  4/22/2011

		- If the UIMFLibrary.dll.rollback file was not in the source folder, then the
		  newer file would typically not get overwritten in the target folder

		- Set CopySubdirectoriesToParentFolder to True in the parameter to have subdirectories in the source folder copied to the parent directory of the target folder
	- Now examining the folder defined by RebootCommandFolderPath in the parameter file
		- If a file named ComputerName_RebootNow.txt is found, then the computer is rebooted
		- If a file named ComputerName_ShutdownNow.txt is found, then the computer is shutdown
