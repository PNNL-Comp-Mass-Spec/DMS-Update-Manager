DMS Update Manager Change Log

Version 1.1.4206; July 8, 2011
	- Now looking for files with a suffix of .delete
		- If found, then deletes the file with the same name in the target folder if it exists
		- For example, if the source folder has file PeptideProphetLibrary.dll.delete in it
		  then PeptideProphetLibrary.dll will get deleted in the target folder
	- Updated to Visual Studio 2010

Version 1.0.4129; April 22, 2011
	- Now looking for files with a suffix of .rollback
		- If found, then forces an update of a file if date or size differs, even if the target file is newer
		- For example, if the source folder has file UIMFLibrary.dll.rollback in it
		  then UIMFLibrary.dll will get copied to the target folder even if the date 
		  of the file in the target folder is newer, like this:

			Source folder              Date                 Target Folder    Date
			UIMFLibrary.dll            3/2/2011             UIMFLibrary.dll  4/22/2011

		- If the UIMFLibrary.dll.rollback file was not in the source folder, then the
		  newer file would typically not get overwritten in the target folder
